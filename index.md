## 🛠️ Overview
The **andrej-karpathy-skills** project offers a single `CLAUDE.md` file aimed at enhancing the behavior of Claude Code. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's insights, this document addresses common pitfalls in coding with large language models, helping users avoid common mistakes.

## 📖 About the Issues
Andrej Karpathy highlights several problems that often arise in coding with LLMs:

### 🧐 Hidden Assumptions
Models frequently make incorrect assumptions without verification, which can lead to confusion and errors.

### 💔 Lack of Clarity
These models do not seek clarification when uncertain. They may overlook inconsistencies and fail to present crucial trade-offs.

### 📈 Overcomplication
Models tend to complicate code and create bloated APIs. They may generate over-elaborate constructions instead of simpler, more efficient solutions.

### ❌ Poor Documentation Practices
LLMs sometimes modify or remove comments and code they do not fully understand, which can create further issues.

## 💡 Our Solution
The `CLAUDE.md` file outlines four key principles to tackle these issues directly:

| Principle                 | Addresses                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Think Before Coding**   | Prevents wrong assumptions and hidden confusions |
| **Embrace Simplicity**    | Promotes straightforward code and APIs          |
| **Encourage Clarity**     | Supports clear documentation and comments        |
| **Validate Understanding** | Ensures that code modifications are intentional  |

These principles serve as guidelines for users aiming to improve their coding practices.
